    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to
        write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to
        structurally valid XHTML (or HTML). Thus, “Markdown” is two things: (1) a plain
        text formatting syntax; and (2) a software tool, written in Perl, that converts
        the plain text formatting to HTML. See the Syntax page for details pertaining to
        Markdown’s formatting syntax. You can try it out, right now, using the online
        Dingus. The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it
        as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be
        publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with
        tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by
        several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration
        for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. The best way to get a
        feel for Markdown’s formatting syntax is simply to look at a Markdown-formatted
        document. For example, you can view the Markdown source for the article text on
        this page here: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/index.text (You can
        use this ‘.text’ suffix trick to view the Markdown source for the content of each
        of the pages in this section, e.g. the Syntax and License pages.) Markdown is free
        software, available under a BSD-style open source license. See the License page
        for more information.

    <h1>DISCUSSION LIST</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        I’ve set up a public mailing list for discussion about Markdown. Any topic related
        to Markdown — both its formatting syntax and its software — is fair game for
        discussion. Anyone who is interested is welcome to join. It’s my hope that the
        mailing list will lead to good ideas for future improvements to Markdown.
